Objective 3: ALGORITHM

Task 01: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
1.	Ask the user to enter the “n” number.
2.	Ask the user to enter the “N” number.
3.	// Determine whether N is a divisor of n
4.	If the remainder of n/N is 0
5.	Display “N is a divisor of n”
6.	If the remainder of n/N is not 0
7.	Display “N is not a divisor of n”
8.	// Determine whether N is even or odd
9.	If N is divisible by 2
10.	Display “N is even”
11.	If N is not divisible by 2
12.	Display “N is odd”
