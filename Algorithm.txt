Objective 3: ALGORITHM

Task 01: Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.
1.	Ask the user to enter the “n” number.
2.	Ask the user to enter the “N” number.
3.	// Determine whether N is a divisor of n
4.	If the remainder of n/N is 0
5.	Display “N is a divisor of n”
6.	If the remainder of n/N is not 0
7.	Display “N is not a divisor of n”
8.	// Determine whether N is even or odd
9.	If N is divisible by 2
10.	Display “N is even”
11.	If N is not divisible by 2
12.	Display “N is odd”

Task 03: Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*, /, %).

13.	Ask the user to enter the first number.
14.	Ask the user to enter the second number.
15.	Ask the user to enter an operator (+,-,*, /, %).
16.	If the operator is “+”, display sum of the two numbers.
17.	If the operator is “-”, display difference of the two numbers.
18.	If the operator is “*”, display product of the two numbers.
19.	If the operator is “/”, display quotient of the two numbers.
20.	If the operator is “%”, display remainder of the two numbers.
